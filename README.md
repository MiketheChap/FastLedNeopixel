FastLedNeopixel
===============

Many Neopixel scripts use the Adafruit Neopixel library. 
Some new developers have been working on a new library at FastLED (http://www.fastled.io). 
This library has numerous capabilities, many of which I don't understand. 
Still, I was able to do some nice lighting effects this Christmas (2014) with limited progrmaming experience. 

I wanted to share these with whoever finds them helpful.
